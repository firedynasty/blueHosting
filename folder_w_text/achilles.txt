## Notes: Upright Positioning & Achilles Injury Prevention in Basketball

### **Positioning and Movement**
- **Stay More Upright:**  
  Keep your torso upright and hips back when preparing to rebound or move, rather than leaning your chest far forward over your toes.
- **Reduce Deep Squats:**  
  Avoid deep knee bends and extreme ankle dorsiflexion (foot close to shin) unless absolutely necessary for the play.
- **Balance Weight:**  
  Center your weight over the balls of your feet—avoid shifting too far forward or back.
- **Controlled Movements:**  
  Jump and push off with smooth, controlled motions. Avoid explosive movements from a deeply flexed, forward-leaning position.
- **Protect the Achilles:**  
  Upright, balanced posture allows your calf muscles to absorb force and reduces excessive strain on the Achilles tendon.

### **Preventative Tips**
- **Calf Strengthening:**  
  Do regular calf raises and eccentric heel drops to build tendon and muscle resilience.
- **Ankle Mobility:**  
  Stretch your calves and work on ankle flexibility to allow safe movement without overstressing the tendon.
- **Proper Warm-Up:**  
  Always warm up thoroughly before playing, focusing on dynamic stretches for the calves and ankles.
- **Gradual Load Increase:**  
  Increase intensity and playing time gradually to avoid sudden overload on your tendons.
- **Listen to Your Body:**  
  Rest and address any calf tightness, soreness, or minor strains before they become bigger issues.
- **Supportive Footwear:**  
  Wear basketball shoes that provide good heel and ankle support.
